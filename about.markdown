### About
#### Inspector Gopher Presents: GoGo Gadget Cloud

**GoGo Gadget Cloud** represents a groundbreaking initiative showcasing the effective use of Go in modern cloud environments. Our goal is to redefine how developers interact with the cloud through Go's powerful features.

#### Core Features:

- **Integrated Approach**: Seamlessly blend application and deployment code within the same structure.
- **Optimizing Go Compiler**: Utilize the Go compiler to its fullest for a streamlined DevOps experience.
- **Enhanced Security with Least Privileges**: Implement least privilege principles robustly within your cloud environment.
- **Go-Styled AWS APIs**: Adapt AWS APIs to align with Go’s idiomatic style for a more natural development experience.
- **Unit Testing Support**: Comprehensive support for unit testing, ensuring reliable and robust code.
- **Lambda-Focused Runtime**: Prioritize AWS Lambda as the primary runtime, optimizing for serverless architectures.
- **Developer-Centric Design**: Focus on the developer’s workflow, prioritizing ease of use and intuitive design.

#### Open Framework Principles:

- **No Code Generation**: Eliminate the need for 'go generate' or any code generation steps.
- **Customizable CloudFormation Templates**: Incrementally generate complete CloudFormation templates, allowing integration with your CI/CD framework.
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Reduce application code boilerplate while retaining full control over application structure.
- **CLI-Friendly Design**: Ensure main and subprograms are executable via CLI with clear interfaces.
- **Flexible Staging Options**: Adopt an open approach to staging environments, accommodating various deployment strategies.

#### Setting Expectations:

- **A Comprehensive Solution**: While extensive, GoGo Gadget Cloud may not meet every specific need. It's a substantial framework designed for broad but not universal applications.
- **Focused Excellence**: Our aim is not to excel in every aspect, such as being the top DynamoDB mapper, but to deliver outstanding overall performance and usability in cloud development with Go.
