GoGo Gadget Cloud is an attempt to show how Go can be used effectively in the modern cloud.

# Basic Features

GoGo Gadget Cloud wants to show case

* Mixing Application and Deployment Code in the same structure
* Using the Go Compiler to the fullest extent for a seamless DevOps experience
* Fixing Least Privileges
* Adapting AWS APIs to be more _Go_ Style
* Support for Unit Testing
* Using Lambda as the main runtime
* Be Develop First, i.e. structure and flow of a developer

Gogo Gadget should be open:

* No need for `go generate`, no code generation
* Incremental generation of full cloudformation templates to use your own CI/CD framework
* Minimal Application Code boilerplate, full control in the way you structure your application
* Main and Subprograms are all executable via CLI and are well _interfaced_ 
* Open approach to staging

GoGo Gadget will not:

* Make everybody happy, i.e. its a big framework
* Won't be the best in everything, i.e. won't be the best DynamoDB mapper
