# Setup

## Getting the code

You need to checkout three projects for now:

- [Gadget](https://github.com/GoGoGadgetCloud/gadget) The main library which you embed into your application
- [Gadget-Cli](https://github.com/GoGoGadgetCloud/gadget-cli) An application used to manage and deploy your application
- [Gadget-Demo](https://github.com/GoGoGadgetCloud/gadget-demo) The demo application - currently the only "supported" one.

This is in an extremely pre-alpha stage, to gauge the feedback from the AWS and Go community and is far beyond any usage. See the roadmap for details.

## Preparing for Use

The `gadget-cli` and the `gadget` library could be releases as modules, but due to the rapid development of the interfaces and contracts, its best to use locale dependencies. We use a `go.work` setup for this:

```
go 1.21.5

use (
        ./gadget
        ./gadget-cli
        ./gadget-demo
)
```
